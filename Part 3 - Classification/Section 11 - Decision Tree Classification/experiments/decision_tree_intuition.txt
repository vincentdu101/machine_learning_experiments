Decision Tree Intuition 

CART
- Classification Trees
-- classifies data

- Regression Trees
-- predict outcomes

How does it work 
- splits data into different sections 
- splits selected by minimizing entropy 
- algorithm looks for optimal split into splits (leaves)
- each split checks for a condition to see which leave a point belongs to 

Decision Tree Facts
- old method, not as popular 
- reborn with new upgrades
- upgrades are additional methods build on decision tree
-- Random Forest
-- Gradient Boosting
