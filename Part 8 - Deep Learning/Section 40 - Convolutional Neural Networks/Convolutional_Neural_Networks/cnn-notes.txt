Convolutional Networks (CNN)
- Yann Lecun pioneering Facebook AI 

How it works
- Input image goes in, CNN classifies it, and output labels describing what it is
- Face of smiling person, CNN classifies it, and outputs it is happy
- recognizing features of image to determine what it is 

How does it recognize features
- given on black and white and a colored image
- converts the b/w image into a 2d array with every pixel on a range from 0 to 255 
- this represents the intensity of the color, ranging from black to white and grayscale
in between 
- in colored image it is a 3d array of pixels with red, green, and blue layer (RGB)
- each layer has its own intensity of the color, (0 to 255), by combining the 
three colors we form a color for each pixel
- for b/w we can also have a boolean that shows 1 or 0 to showcase when to turn on black 
vs white
